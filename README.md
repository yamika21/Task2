# Heart Disease Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient attributes. The model uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

## Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on various medical attributes, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other medical test results. The project uses machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model, evaluate its performance, and improve the model through hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Disease UCI dataset** available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 14 attributes, including:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- And other medical test results

The dataset is used to train the machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow (if you're working with deep learning)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
